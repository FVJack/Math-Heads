    sentences:
    - Time to test out those extra tools.
    - The grid got a bit of an upgrade to help you.
    - There's also a few new buttons.  Projections will toggle on/off your vectors
      projected onto the XY, XZ, YZ planes.
    - The Anchors button wills show a connecting line from the end point of the vectors
      in space to the projections.
    - Finally, to help see things better, you can turn on/off entire planes to eliminate
      clutter when you need it.
