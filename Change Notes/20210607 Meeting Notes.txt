Update Log Since Last:
----------------------
Refactoring PlayerData:
- Code across levels slightly refactored
- Need to centralize data into GameRoot for transfer to database
Things Learned about GSFU and Drive:
- When retrieving from database, if the item doesn't exist Drive doesn't respond
- Essentially it's impossible to tell the difference between "no internet connection" and "not found"
- To combat this, a Debug sheet in database was added
- Before attempting to create/login/join, the game bounces a response off the database "debug" sheet
- After verifying connection between game and database it flips to the attempted login type
Changes with User Accounts:
- User accounts have updated incrimenting
- If a person making an account is unique in first.last, then their username is just first.last
- The next person to create an account with that same first.last will be assigned first.last1
- Then first.last2, and so on
- Still no password recovery atm.  Need to add further datacollection to associate to account first
Admin Accounts:
- The major overhaul of this update is the Admin accounts
- After an account is created in-game the traditional way, the account can be flagged as Admin in the database
- When logging into the game, the game checks if the logging user is flagged admin
- If they are, they are not dropped right into the game, instead they given a new Admin Panel
- Admins can create Sessions for specific events, and set when that sessions expires
- Further planning to add controls so admins can modify the session to lock to certain puzzles, etc
Sessions:
- The next major change is the Sessions join
- Sessions are one time play user accounts
- There are two types of sessions: Classroom and Expo/Demo
- Classroom sessions allow anyone from any machine to join under that session if they have the session name
- Classroom does not require a password to login, only the session name
- Expo turns that specific machine to change how clicking the "Play" button works
- Once an admin has activated "Expo" the play button will not take people to a login screen
- Instead, everytime "Play" is clicked, a new game is started under the session name of the Expo
- Expo requires nothing from the person playing, and is exited upon restarting the game(closing)
- That said, you can join multiple machines into Expo/Demo by having them "Join Session" using the Expo session name
PuzzleData Tracking
- First swing at puzzle data tracking.
